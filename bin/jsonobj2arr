# takes json objects and makes them a csv structure:
#    [{foo:1, bar:2}, {foo:3,bar:4}]
#        ...would become:
#    [
#      ['foo', 'bar']
#      [    1,    2 ]
#      [    3,    4 ]
#    ]
# additional args are passed to jq, such as -s if your input is newline-sep json objects
# add `jq @csv` to acutally turn this into valid CSV
